Storyteller
===========

Minimalist user stories for test/unit

Examples
--------

    require "test/unit"
    require "rubygems"
    require "context"
    require "storyteller"
    
    class MyAcceptanceTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      include Test::Storyteller
      
      story <<-EOS
        As a developer
        I want to have user stories on test/unit that look pretty
        So that I can have nice acceptance tests
      EOS
      
      scenario "So simple it's awesome" do
        # ...
      end
      
      scenario "OMG I'm so ruling the world with this" do
        # ...
      end
    end

And when run that produces:

    $ ruby my_acceptance_test.rb
    Loaded suite my_acceptance_test
    Started

If you have multiple classes that include Test::Storyteller (or that inherit
from a common base class that includes it), then each story will get printed
in turn, with the scenarios run below it.

And best of all: **in full beautiful color** (cause what's the point if it
ain't pretty?)

Installing
==========

    sudo gem sources add http://gems.github.com
    sudo gem install foca-storyteller

OMG why not use Cucumber?
=========================

I like Cucumber and use it, but it's just a whole new layer of complexity when
you don't have business people checking and reviewing your user stories. Simple
requirements need simple solutions.
